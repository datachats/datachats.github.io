## About

**Data Chats** is a data lunch and learn series at the Ottawa Research and Development Centre (Experimental Farm site). 

We're composed of research scientists, technicians and natural history collections staff who have been meeting monthly since May 2019 to talk data (woohoo!). More specifically, during 'Data Chats' sessions we talk about data management, data analytics and data science with a focus on scientific data (e.g., genomics, plant trait data).
